# Acknowledgments

This project is the result of a collaborative effort, combining academic guidance, powerful developer tools, and dedicated teamwork. We would like to express our gratitude to the following people and organizations.

## 🎓 Academic Guidance

First and foremost, we extend our sincere thanks to **Dr. Alessandro Bruno** and **IULM University**.

The invaluable guidance provided during the **"Data Mining & Text Analytics"** course laid the theoretical foundation for this work and gave us the necessary skills to apply NLP techniques to real-world data.

## 🛠️ Resources

We thank **Google API Services** for providing the developer tools that allowed us to extract YouTube comments, experiment with large datasets, and analyze fan sentiment effectively.

We also would like to point out the usage of AI Tools during the coding and development part, and extensive vibe-coding implementations with:
**Gemini 3 Pro High**

## 👩‍💻 The Team

This project was a **team effort** by **Alice Maestri**, **Chiara Saponara**, and **Eleonora Maraccini**. While we collaborated closely on every phase of the pipeline, we would like to highlight our individual contributions:

* **Chiara Saponara**
    * Conceived the initial idea to run sentiment analysis on movie and TV series commentary.
    * Established the project setup and created the data extraction pipeline (`data_acquisition.py`).
    * Developed the prototype for the sentiment analysis logic (`sentiment_analysis.py`).

* **Alice Maestri**
    * Refined and improved the initial codebases to create the final versions.
    * Managed the project documentation, including writing the `README` file and structuring the final GitHub repository.
    * Assisted in the implementation of each development step.

* **Eleonora Maraccini**
    * Provided comprehensive assistance at every stage of creation, including research and code writing.
    * Responsible for testing the code at each iteration to ensure stability.
    * Proofread and validated all documentation and code outputs throughout the pipeline.
